# Attire
We would love for our guests to wear their best summery, semi-formal attire! Austin’s June temperatures typically reach upwards of 93°F, and while the ceremony will be in the shade, we want everyone to stay cool and comfortable. We recommend wearing lightweight, breathable fabrics to beat the heat. For outfit inspiration, feel free to use this guide:
